        <h2>Life In Programming</h2>
        <p>
          Programming is a process that leads from an original formulation of a computing problem to executable computer programs. It involves activities such as analysis, developing understanding, generating algorithms, verification of
          requirements of algorithms including their correctness and resources consumption, and implementation (commonly referred to as coding) of algorithms in a target programming language. Source code is written in one or more programming languages. As referenced from Wikipedia, but to me programming is a whole process that involves observation of a problem, breaking down the problem, and comimg up with a solution as you interact with your computer on a digital level.
          <br>
          As a young developer learning and also implementing new ideas practically everday I have grown mentally and improved on previously aquired skills, with resources such as Moringa School, Google and Codecademy to mention a few.

          <h3>My Life Away From Coding</h3>
          <p>
            All work and no play makes Ramza a sad boy... Life advice if you are reading this, don't sit on your computer screen all day, it has serious health effects in the long run. During my free time I'm with earphones listening to music and doing any of the following-
            <ul>
              <li>Swimming</li>
              <li>Basketball</li>
              <li>Hiking</li>
              <li>Bungee Jumping </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Music is everything to me, It helps me focus when doing anyting. I'm an all rounder and team player in many outdoor activities, and enjoy team activities that envolve participation and team building :-)
