        <h2>Life In Programming</h2>
        <p>
          Programming is a process that leads from an original formulation of a computing problem to executable computer programs. It involves activities such as analysis, developing understanding, generating algorithms, verification of requirements of algorithms including their correctness and resources consumption, and implementation (commonly referred to as coding) of algorithms in a target programming language. Source code is written in one or more programming languages. As referenced from Wikipedia, but to me programming is a the process involving observation of a problem, breaking it down to simple understandable concepts, and finally comimg up with a solution as you interact with your computer on a digital level.
          <br><br>
          As a learning developer implementing new ideas practically everday, I have grown mentally and improved on previously acquired skills, with access to resources such as Moringa School, Google and Codecademy to mention a few. It mainly falls on the individual and how they choose to use available resources.

          <h3>My Life Away From Coding</h3>
          <p>
            All work and no play... You know the rest. Life advice, don't sit on your computer screen all day, it has serious health effects in the long run. Get up, do some streches, drink plenty of water, involve yourself in various activities, it definately helps. During my free time, I enjoy music, podcasts -a specifically interesting way to learn new things- or a good SitCom. <br><br>
            I engage in some outdoor activities like-
            <ul>
              <li>Swimming</li>
              <li>Basketball</li>
              <li>Hiking</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Music is everything to me, helps me focus when doing my work. I am an all round team player, and enjoy team activities that envolve participation and team building. I am looking forward to take on a sport in the near future. Currently I train as a swimmer. I picture sports as a way to break monotomy in daily activities.
